    Each annotation init receives the coordinates for the specific type, label, and optional attributes. A binary mask should be exactly the same dimensions as the image item, with 0 for background and 1 for the annotation.

    ## Convert Mask to Polygon
    The Dataloop SDK includes a function to convert a semantic mask to a polygon annotation, which is often easier to edit and work with in the UI.
    The following example filters for items with semantic mask annotations, and converts them into Polygon annotations.
